Seeding and Truncating the Cache
--------------------------------

From the page that lists the demos there is a link for seeding each layer. Seeding and truncating layers with parameter filters is currently not supported, except for the default values.

There is also a RESTful interface for seeding: http://geowebcache.org/trac/wiki/GWC_seeder

Resource Allocation
-------------------

Also see http://geowebcache.org/trac/wiki/resources for tools that can be used to estimate how much storage you need and how long seeding will take
