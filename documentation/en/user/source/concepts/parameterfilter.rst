Parameter Filter
================

Parameter filters provide templates for extracting arbitrary parameters from the requests. This makes it possible to use GeoWebCache in scenarios such as time series data, multiple styles for the same layer or with CQL filters set by the client.

This section is incomplete, please contribute. See the exhaustive configuration example and the XSD documentation for how to use the included parameter filter implementations.
