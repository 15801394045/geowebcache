GeoWebCache |release|
=====================

GeoWebCache is a J2EE web application used to cache map tiles coming from a variety of sources such as such as OGC WebMap Servier (WMS). It implements various service interfaces (such as WMS-C, WMTS, TMS, Google Maps KML, Virtual Earth) in order to accelerate and optimize map image delivery.  As of version 1.2.2 it can also recombine tiles to work with regular WMS clients.
