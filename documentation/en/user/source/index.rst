GeoWebCache |release|
=====================

GeoWebCache is a J2EE web application used to cache map tiles coming from a variety of sources such as such as OGC WebMap Servier (WMS). It implements various service interfaces (such as WMS-C, WMTS, TMS, Google Maps KML, Virtual Earth) in order to accelerate and optimize map image delivery.  As of version 1.2.2 it can also recombine tiles to work with regular WMS clients.

This user manual is a guide to many aspects of using GeoWebCache. If you have unanswered questions you can get community support on the `geowebcache-users list <https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geowebcache-users>`_.
