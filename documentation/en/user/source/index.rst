GeoWebCache |release|
=====================

GeoWebCache is a Java servlet used to cache OGC services such as WMS. It supports a large variety of clients/protocols, including WMTS, WMS-C, TMS, KML / Google Earth, Google Maps, and Bing Maps. As of version 1.2.2 it can also recombine tiles to work with regular WMS clients.
