WMS-C - WMS Tiling Clients
==========================

The WMS Tiling Client Recommendation, or WMS-C for short, is a recommendation set forth by OSGeo for making tiled requests using WMS. You can read more about it here: 

On the front page of your GeoWebCache instance you will find a link to the WMS-C GetCapabilities document. The automatically generated OpenLayers clients also use the WMS requests and follow the WMS+C recommendation.

GeoWebCache is seeking funding for a full WMS implementation, i.e. recombining and subsampling tiles to answer arbitrary WMS requests.
